## Features
* Live tracking of your map runs and other activities
* Calculation of statistics
* Bossing Info

## How it works
All we need is the path to your game logfile (Client.txt). TraXile will read the whole file the first time. After that it is live
tracking your logfile for updates.

## Virus Warnings
As I am not using a Code signing certificate, some virus scanners (e.g. Windows defender) will trigger an alert. You can start it anyway. This is not a virus :-)
