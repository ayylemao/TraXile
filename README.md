## Features
* Live tracking of your map runs and other activities
* Calculation of statistics

## How it works
All we need is the path to your game logfile (Client.txt). TraXile will read the whole file the first time. After that it is live
tracking your logfile for updates.

## How to install
Just download the latest release from the GitHub releases page, extract it and start with "TraXile.exe"
